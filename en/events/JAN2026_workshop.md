## Introduction

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly transforming structural biology, enabling breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and large-scale simulation-driven discovery. These workflows are increasingly software-intensive, compute-heavy, and data-rich, often producing results that cannot be easily captured, shared, or evaluated using traditional publication-centric models of scientific assessment.

This workshop brings together domain scientists, data experts, and research policy practitioners to explore how AI-enabled structural biology workflows can be made reproducible, FAIR, and responsibly assessed, without requiring unrestricted data sharing or compromising intellectual property and data sovereignty. Convened in connection with the **CODATA OT-ViRARe Task Group**, the workshop will treat structural biology as a real-world test case for emerging frameworks in data visitation, semantic metadata, AI governance, and research assessment reform.

### Objectives

The workshop aims to:

- Examine AI-driven structural biology workflows (protein 3D analysis, docking, molecular dynamics) from the perspectives of reproducibility, provenance, and explainability

- Explore how FAIR and AI-ready metadata can describe complex simulation pipelines, models, and parameters

- Discuss how such software-mediated research outputs should be responsibly assessed beyond journal publications

- Demonstrate hands-on use cases illustrating secure, controlled, and visitation-based analysis

- Generate insights that will inform the **Open Research Assessment Toolkit (ORAT)** under the **OT-ViRARe** Task Group
