- **Summary of the Retrieved articles:** `amilib` is used to create datatables having informations about the title, abstract and year of publications etc. in a table format.
- **Summarization:** The text in the PDF can be summarized to get overview and summary of the content. 
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** This analysis involves the extraction of Plant species, chemicals, diseases, location etc. from the research articles.
