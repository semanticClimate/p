- Disaster Resilience that can be built or enhanced through a multi-faceted approach to building resilience; 

- Data information and exchange for decision-making;

- Contribution of valuable data and insights into disaster risks and vulnerabilities;

- Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and Goal 13 (Climate Action) by promoting strategies that reduce risk and enhance resilience;

- Innovation and Technology Transfer through stakeholder engagement that can stimulate innovation by sharing successful technologies and methodologies in disaster management, allowing countries to adopt effective solutions tailored to their specific contexts; and

- Awareness and Education by engaging stakeholders can enhance public awareness around the importance of DRR, fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience within communities.
