**Climate Quest** is an interactive workshop, designed  to help middle school students to explore the science and ideas behind climate change in a playful, hands-on way. Through games, puzzles, and teamwork challenges, they will uncover concepts like tipping points, resilience, and the importance of working together.

This program emphasizes curiosity, creativity, and collaboration—turning climate anxiety into climate hope, and helping young minds see themselves as protectors of the planet.
