**[Open Access Week 2025](https://www.openaccessweek.org/)** (OAW 2025) brings together communities worldwide to advance open sharing of knowledge. The event will take place from **October 20–26, 2025**.

It includes global, community-led campaign to promote open access, open science, and equitable sharing of knowledge—through talks, workshops, policy dialogue, and collective action.

#### Theme for OAW 2025 is “Who Owns Our Knowledge?”

### semanticClimate Participation

#### Date : October 24, 2025

We are participating in the OAW 2025 by hosting talk and workshop on opening up climate knowledge and scholarly literatures.

Our sessions will explore how semantic tools can be used to make research more transparent, equitable, and impactful—ensuring that critical knowledge is available to all, not locked behind paywalls.

The title of the session is **"Open Science and Citizen Science with #semanticClimate: Open-Software for Knowledge Liberation"**.

### Session 1 (Workshop): Corpus creation from open access repositories and their analysis with semantic tools

- Presented by Ms. Udita Agarwal, Ph.D Student, BRIC-National Institute of Plant Genome Research (BRIC-NIPGR) and Dr. Renu Kumari, Program Manager #semanticClimate and Ms. Shaik Zainab, Anurag University, Hyderabad.

- Time 8:30 - 9:45 AM EST | **7:00 – 8:15 PM IST**

This session includes hands-on demonstration of semantic tool `pygetpapers` to create corpus of the open access literatures in a structured and machine readable format for further analysis on the corpus.

The applications of the semantic and structured corpus are the following:

- To train Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for:
    - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    - Automated summarization
- Facilitate literature reviews:
    - for identifying research gaps
    - help in formulating hypotheses

This has also led to resolve the following challenges associated with exponential growth of publications.

- Bulk download of the data in less time
- Machine readable format 
- Single platform to access the data
- Automated article retrieval from open access repositories
- Updated record of literatures


### Session 2 (Talk): Who Owns Our Knowledge? An Introduction to the #semanticClimate

- By Dr. Gitanjali Yadav, Co-founder #semanticClimate and Scientist at BRIC-National Institute of Plant Genome Research (BRIC-NIPGR), New Delhi, India

- Time 12:30 0- 1:50 PM EST | **11:00 PM – 12:20 AM IST**
