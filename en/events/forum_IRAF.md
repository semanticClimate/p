### Rationale 

As India rapidly advances in science, technology, and higher education, there is a growing need to rethink how research quality and academic performance are assessed. Traditional, publication-centric models are no longer adequate in an era marked by open science, FAIR data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and AI-powered research. Global initiatives like COARA, DORA, and the Barcelona Declaration have called for more responsible, inclusive, and mission-driven research assessment practices. At the same time, India's National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and its expanding AI and digital innovation ecosystem present an opportunity to embed research assessment reform at the heart of national education and research strategy.

The Indian Research Assessments Forum (IRAF) is being proposed as a national platform to catalyze, coordinate, and institutionalize the transformation of research assessment practices in India. It will support policy coherence, enable capacity building, and promote ethical, context-sensitive, and inclusive assessment models.

**Strategic Importance of this Forum For India**

- **Global Alignment:** IRAF can align India with international best practices in research assessment, ensuring we are part of global reform conversations (e.g., COARA, DORA)

- **National Framework:** It offers a structured, indigenous platform to rethink how academic merit, impact, and innovation are assessed across diverse Indian institutions and disciplines

- **Inclusivity & Diversity:** India’s linguistic, disciplinary, and institutional diversity demands context-sensitive assessment models—IRAF can foster these, including support for multilingualism and epistemic diversity

- **AI & Digital Integration:** With NEP 2020 introducing AI into curricula and research, IRAF can provide ethical and explainable AI assessment guidelines to safeguard scientific integrity

- **Capacity Building:** IRAF could drive training and literacy programs on open science, data governance, and AI tools—empowering reviewers, researchers, and policy-makers

- **Policy Synergy:** It can serve as a nodal body to coordinate between ministries (Education, Science & Tech, AI governance) and funding agencies to harmonize reforms

### Objectives of the IRAF

- To align Indian research assessment practices with global responsible assessment frameworks (e.g., COARA, OpenAIRE).
- To recognize the full diversity of research outputs—including datasets, software, community impact, and interdisciplinary work.
- To incorporate AI explainability, provenance tracking, and ethics into research evaluation.
- To enable multilingual and culturally inclusive assessment systems reflective of India’s research landscape.
- To support training programs on AI literacy and open science practices for researchers, funders, and peer reviewers.

### Next Steps

- Formal launch of IRAF during the [National Summit on Data, AI, and Research Assessment](https://semanticclimate.github.io/p/en/events/ALR_June25/).
- Establishment of a secretariat with working groups on key themes (AI & Ethics, Open Science, Discipline-Specific Frameworks, Capacity Building).
- Development of an **Indian Declaration on Responsible Research Assessment**.
