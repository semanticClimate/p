### Rationale 

As India rapidly advances in science, technology, and higher education, there is a growing need to rethink how research quality and academic performance are assessed. Traditional, publication-centric models are no longer adequate in an era marked by open science, FAIR data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and AI-powered research. Global initiatives like COARA, DORA, and the Barcelona Declaration have called for more responsible, inclusive, and mission-driven research assessment practices. At the same time, India's National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and its expanding AI and digital innovation ecosystem present an opportunity to embed research assessment reform at the heart of national education and research strategy.

The Indian Research Assessments Forum (IRAF) is being proposed as a national platform to catalyze, coordinate, and institutionalize the transformation of research assessment practices in India. It will support policy coherence, enable capacity building, and promote ethical, context-sensitive, and inclusive assessment models.
