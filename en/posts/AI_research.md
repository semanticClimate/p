## Insights from the Indo-Swiss Workshop: ‘Research Integrity in the Age of AI’

### Benefits of AI for researchers
- Planning of Projects, hypothesis
- Planning of experimental design
- Proposal optimization
- Data analysis
- Reports and publication preparation
- for structuring and cleaning the data
- AI-generated review reports and summarization
- automated screening
- AI-assisted reproducibility
- figure creation
- workflow augmentation

### Disadvantages of AI for researchers
- Inaccurate and incomplete literature knowledge
- inherent bias in the AI
- lack of reference AI is using
- non compliance with regulators
- synthetic data
- Authorship confusion

### AI: Opportunities for Publishers and Funders
- To check plagiarism in the manuscript/ project
- Pre-screening of submission
- Identification of multiple publication
- To check language improvement
- Identification of the referee
- Checking references in the manuscript/ project

#### What is needed? AI (Artificial Intelligence) and RI (Research Integrity)
- Self-appraisal checklists for researchers and institutions
- Clear and dynamic rules and guidelines
- Implementation and incorporation into good scientific practice documentation
- Broader awareness of the benefits and the disadvantages

### Some Propositions for responsible and ethical use of AI 
- Keypoints taken from the presentation by Prof. Suman Chakraborty, Director, IIT Kharagpur

#### 1. Trusted Research Ledger

It is the institution based system to keep the records of datasets, protocols, approvals and authorship information. Each project transcation and experimental details should be logged transparently.

  - ensures auditability
  - foster reproducibility
  - builds inter-lab trust
  - prevents data-tempering

#### 2. AI Integrity Sandbox
  
- A dedicated system where AI tools used in research analysis are evaluated periodically for reproducibility, bias and transparency.

- There should be independent validation of AI-assisted workflow used by researchers. 

- All the AI outputs should be reliably verified and reproduced.


#### 3. Integrity Scorecard

- A digital dashboard integrated with existing R&D management system.
- It supports healthy competition.
- A transparent and quantifiable system for audit success and open access compliance.
- Builds culture of accountability
- It provides data-driven insights.

#### 4. Open Lab Notebooks

It is a digital lab notebooks inspired by open science principles which is partially or fully accessible to external collaborators and the public.

The notebooks should include:
- experimental protocols
- published data etc.

It promotes open ethical and reproducible science and accelerates collaborations.

#### 5. Research Ombudsman and Rapid Response Team

An Institute should have independent department with dedicated response team for research integrity concerns. It should be dedicated to provide confidential consultation and ensures fair and timely resolution of the concerns.

Important features:
- A multidisciplinary rapid response team including senior faculty member and trained staff.
- It should encourage early conflict resolution.
- Confidential Advisory role to discuss potential issues.
- It should publish annual reports highlighting trends.
- It should have standard procedures for registering complaints, mediation and documentation.

Benefits:
- It strengthens trust and psychological safety across the academic ecosystem.
- promotes transparency and fairness

### COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) : Three key policies
1. AI can not be an author as it is not a legal enity and it also can not take responsibility for the research.
2. There should no uploading of confidential manuscript and projects by the reviewers and editors to external AI tools. 
3. The final decisions on the manuscript should not be made by Artificial Intelligence but AI can help in peer review, making recommendation etc.
